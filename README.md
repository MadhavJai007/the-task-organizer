# Task organizer

A simple task organizer app to create and manage tasks. Choose whether you want your tasks to have a deadline or not and when you should get them done by.

Designed with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 conventions, the app should be visually consistent with the rest of your device's themes on Android 13 and later.
